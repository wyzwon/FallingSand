# FallingSand
This project seeks to recreate and improve upon the classic cellular automaton sandbox in Canvas using JavaScript to allow native browser support.

## Getting Started
The project should come readily launchable after download but it is recommended that you have a website to push it to. You will also have to redirect the favicon or you will encounter errors.

### Prerequisites
A modern web browser with Canvas support such as
* [Chrome] (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)
* [Firefox] (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* [Opera] (http://www.opera.com/)
* Safari (Version 9 and up)
* Edge
* Internet Explorer (Version 9 and up)

A text editor of your choice

##Deployment
As noted in "Getting Started" the project will work as is when put on a website.

## Authors
Thomas Bouffard

## Acknowledgments

* Alexandre Gomes - For his [getScrollBarWidth] (http://www.alexandre-gomes.com/?p=115) function.

## Note on commit statistics
The repository stats state that I released 25 commits the say I made the project,
this is because I started this as a class project and while I saved versions as I went,
I did not have the foresight to create a repository. The 25 posted versions where pushed to maintain the history
but mess with the development statistics because they are not properly time stamped.
